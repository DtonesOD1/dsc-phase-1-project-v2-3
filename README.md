   ## Project Specifics:
   
   Tasked with making 3 recommendations to Microsoft which was achieved by importing data, cleaning it, then visualize and interpret it.
   
   ## Data:
   
   The data was imported from IMDB and web-scraped from The Numbers.
   Cleaning involved removing NaN's, adding and dropping colums, converting objects to floats/integers, removing duplicates, etc.
   
   The data was then presented in dataframes and some basic functions were applied to show counts, median/means and ROI.
   From there visuals were created that further highlighted the data that was used to make the conclusions.
